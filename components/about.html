            I am self taught developer, been learning it since late 2020 and was
            lucky enough to change careers less than a year later. <br />
            <br />
            Most of my projects were done using Javascript/Typescript and React
            and/or Node.js but I'm also familiar with other languages and
            frameworks. <br />
            <br />
            Although I'm now just beginning this new chapter, I also bring 10
            plus years work experience in a sales/events enviroment. Can't wait
            for what the future will bring! ðŸš€
